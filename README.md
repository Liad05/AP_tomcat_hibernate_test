# Scrabble Game

This is a Java-based Scrabble game developed with an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. It follows the original rules of Scrabble, where players take turns forming words on a 15x15 game board. The game supports multi-platform gameplay, allowing for cross-play between PC and Android devices.

## Features

- **MVVM Structure**: The project follows the MVVM architectural pattern, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase.

- **Client-Server Connectivity**: The game supports multiplayer functionality through client-server connectivity.

- **HTTP Requests and Tomcat Servlet**: Communication between client and server is facilitated using HTTP requests (POST and GET) and a Tomcat Servlet.

- **MySQL Server Integration**: The game state can be saved and loaded at a later date through a MySQL server.

- **Cross-Platform Play**: A companion [Android app](https://github.com/Liad05/Scrabbler_game_android_app) built on the same logic and functionality as the PC version, supports cross-platform play.
